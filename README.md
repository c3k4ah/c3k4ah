### üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª Who am I ?
Hey ! My name is DOMINICK Randriamanantena Gr√©goire. I am currently in Antananarivo, Madagascar, but I come from a small town called [Mahanoro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p2e5PzvcvRZn9tRG9).
I am passionate about mobile development, currently with Flutter. But also interested about Back-end development and I'm learning Golang at the moment.



### üõ†Ô∏è My Flutter Skills

- **`Widget Customization`**: Proficient in creating custom widgets tailored to specific design requirements. I have experience building reusable and efficient components that enhance user interfaces and improve app performance.

- **`RESTful APIs`**: Skilled in integrating RESTful APIs to communicate with backend services, fetch data, and ensure smooth, real-time app functionality. I use HTTP and Dio packages and error handling best practices to maintain a reliable connection between the app and server.

- **`State Management`**: Expertise in managing state effectively in Flutter applications using popular tools (mainly with Flutter Bloc). I understand the importance of state management in maintaining the app's responsiveness and performance.

- **`Firebase Integration`**: Experienced in integrating Firebase services, including Firestore, Authentication, and Cloud Messaging, to add backend functionality such as data storage, user authentication, and push notifications to apps.

- **`Package Management`**: Well-versed in using Dart's pub.dev to manage dependencies and packages efficiently, ensuring that projects stay up-to-date and maintainable. I carefully choose packages that enhance functionality while keeping the app's size and performance in mind.

- **`Clean Architecture`**: Strong understanding of Clean Architecture principles, ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase. I structure projects to separate concerns effectively, following best practices that promote code reuse and improve the overall quality of applications.

- **`Debugging`**: Proficient in using Flutter's powerful debugging tools like the Dart DevTools, breakpoints, and logging to identify and fix issues quickly, ensuring a smooth user experience and bug-free application.

- **`Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)`**: Knowledgeable in setting up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions to automate build, and deployment processes, ensuring quick and reliable delivery of updates.

- **`Responsive Design`**: Skilled in creating responsive and adaptive UI layouts that work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience regardless of the platform.

- **`Localization and Internationalization`**: Experienced in implementing localization and internationalization in Flutter apps to support multiple languages and regions, making the app accessible to a global audience.

- **...There are still more skills and I would be happy to detail them to you during an interview. But you can follow the progress of my [flutter roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/flutter?s=674c862a5039431075d58732) OR check [my portfolio](https://c3k4ah.github.io).**
